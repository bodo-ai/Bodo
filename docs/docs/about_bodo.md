- HPC compiler optimizes compute operations aggressively, leading to high efficiency for expensive compute-heavy queries.
- HPC parallel architecture with MPI ensures maximum parallel execution efficiency and scalability.
- Plugin architecture with Snowflake SQL compatibility and Iceberg storage as well as Snowflake native storage support breaks vendor lock-in and enables a multi-engine environment.
    


Bodo is delivered as a simple SaaS service and can be plugged into existing data stacks easily:

- Plugin Bodo SDK in your Airflow or other scripts to submit queries.
- Use Bodo connectors for existing ETL tools to use Bodo immediately.
- Bodo managed clusters stay in your own AWS/Azure account ensuring no data leaves your environment.
