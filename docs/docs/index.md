# About Bodo

Bodo is a high performance SQL & Python compute engine that brings HPC and supercomputing techniques to data processing for the first time and combines them with database optimizations:

- HPC compiler optimizes compute operations aggressively, leading to high efficiency for expensive compute-heavy queries.
- HPC parallel architecture with MPI ensures maximum parallel execution efficiency and scalability.
- Plugin architecture with Snowflake SQL compatibility and Iceberg storage as well as Snowflake native storage support breaks vendor lock-in and enables a multi-engine environment.

- Bodo managed clusters stay in your own AWS/Azure account ensuring no data leaves your environment.
