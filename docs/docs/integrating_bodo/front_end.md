# Integrating Bodo with Front-End Tools {#front_end}

Bodo can be integrated with front-end tools to build real-time analytics
dashboards. This page provides a walk-through of creating a
[Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/){target=blank} app with Bodo on your laptop or VM.

All the code referenced on this page is available
[here](https://github.com/bodo-ai/Bodo-examples), and the steps to
running the app are provided [below][runtaxipickup].

## The Taxi Pickup App

This app is based on a
[demo](https://docs.streamlit.io/library/get-started/create-an-app) from
the official Streamlit documentation, which explores a [public Uber
dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/fivethirtyeight/uber-pickups-in-new-york-city?select=uber-raw-data-sep14.csv)
for pickups and drop-offs in New York City.

We will essentially read a [parquet][parquet-section] file into a dataframe, 
convert the string `date/time` column to datetime data, 
and return the dataframe to be plotted in the app:

```py
def load_data_pandas(pq_file_path, date_col='date/time'):
    data = pd.read_parquet(pq_file_path)
    data[date_col] = pd.to_datetime(data[date_col])
    return data
```

### Bodo version of the Taxi Pickup App

To run the app using Bodo, we will use the same process as running the
app on an [IPyParallel cluster][ipyparallelsetup]. For this app, we want to visualize all the data, so in the
Bodo version of this function, we disable automatic data distribution
using the `returns_maybe_distributed` flag, and use `bodo.gatherv` to
gather all the data onto a single process:

```py
@bodo.jit(returns_maybe_distributed=False, cache=True)
def load_data_bodo(pq_file_path, date_col='date/time'):
    data = pd.read_parquet(pq_file_path)
    data[date_col] = pd.to_datetime(data[date_col])
    return bodo.gatherv(data)
```

We define a Python wrapper for `load_data_bodo` called `build_main`:

```py
def build_main(pq_file_path, date_col='date/time'):
    op_df = load_data_bodo(pq_file_path, date_col='Date/Time')
    return op_df
```

Finally, we need a function to send the imports and code definitions to
the mpi engines, call the `load_data_bodo` function, and then return the
result to the client:

```py
def initialize_bodo(pq_file_path, date_col='date/time'):

    t0 = time.time()

    client = ipp.Client(profile='mpi')
    dview = client[:]
    # import libraries
    dview.execute("import numpy as np")
    dview.execute("import pandas as pd")
    dview.execute("import bodo")
    dview.execute("import time")
    dview.execute("import os")
    dview.execute("import datetime as dt")
    dview.execute("import sys")

    bodo_funcs = [load_data_bodo]

    for f in bodo_funcs:
        # get source code of Bodo function
        f_src = inspect.getsource(f)
        # execute the source code thereby defining the function on engines
        dview.execute(f_src).get()

    op_df = dview.apply(build_main, pq_file_path, 'Date/Time').get()

    t1 = time.time()
    print("Total Exec + Compilation time:", t1-t0)
    client.close()

    return op_df[0]
```

### Building the Streamlit Visualization

We create the Streamlit App by adding the title, creating some headers
and printing out some basic information about our app:

```py
st.title('Scale up your datasets and make Pandas fly with Bodo!')
st.subheader('Based on Streamlit example for Uber pickups in NYC')
st.subheader(' - > Basic Info')
st.subheader('Number of physical cores/ranks available on system: %s' % psutil.cpu_count(logical=False))
```

We first run the Pandas app and see how long it takes:

```py
t0 = time.time()
pdf = load_data_pandas(pq_file_path, date_col='Date/Time')
t1 = time.time()
st.subheader('Pandas df')
st.subheader('Time taken for one op with Pandas:')
st.subheader(t1-t0)
st.write(pdf.head(2)) # print two rows to check output.
```

We do the same with Bodo:

```py
t2 = time.time()
bdf = initialize_bodo(pq_file_path, date_col='Date/Time')
t3 = time.time()
st.subheader('Bodo df')
st.subheader('Total Compilation and Execution time taken for one op with Bodo:')
st.subheader(t3-t2)
st.write(bdf.head(2))
```

We can also visualize the data in a histogram showing the pickups by
hour:

```py
DATE_COLUMN = 'date/time'
lowercase = lambda x: str(x).lower()
bdf.rename(lowercase, axis='columns', inplace=True)
st.subheader('Number of pickups by hour')
hist_values = np.histogram(bdf[DATE_COLUMN].dt.hour, bins=24, range=(0,24))[0]
st.bar_chart(hist_values)
```

## Running the Taxi Pickup App {#runtaxipickup}

Clone the [Bodo Examples](https://github.com/bodo-ai/Bodo-examples)
repository and navigate to the `streamlit` directory. The
directory has the following structure:

```console
streamlit
├── README.md
├── app.py
├── config.py
├── environment.yml
├── pd_vs_Bodo.png
├── sample_parquet_file.pq
```

We have provided an `environment.yml` file to create a conda environment
with all the required dependencies. The app code is stored in `app.py`,
and some configuration parameters such as the input file, and path to
current directory are set in `config.py`. We have provided a sample
parquet file `sample_parquet_file.pq` to test the app with.

!!! note 
    Please ensure that the path to current directory is set in the
    `config.py` file.

### Start the IPyParallel controller and engines

Create a conda environment from the provided `environment.yml` file, and
activate the conda environment:

```shell
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate stlbodo
```

Append the current directory to your Python Path:

```shell
export PYTHONPATH="${PYTHONPATH}:<path_to_directory>"
```
Now you can start ipcontroller:
```shell
ipcontroller --profile mpi --ip '*'
```
Open a new terminal and activate the `stlbodo` conda environment. You
will need to append the current directory to your Python Path again. Use
the following command to start a set of MPI engines:

```shell
mpiexec -n 4 python -m ipyparallel.engine --mpi --profile-dir ~/.ipython/profile_mpi --cluster-id '' --log-level=DEBUG
```

### Run the Streamlit App

Open another terminal and activate the `stlbodo` conda environment.
Navigate to the `streamlit` directory, and then run:

```shell
streamlit run app.py
```

You should now be able to open up the app in a browser window and see
the output for yourself. Note that it will take roughly around one and a
half minute for the Pandas output to show up, and including compilation
time, and following that, less than a minute for for the Bodo output and
visualization to show up.
