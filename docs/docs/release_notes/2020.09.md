Bodo 2020.09 Release (Date: 09/17/2020) {#September_2020}
========================================

This release includes many new features, bug fixes and performance
improvements. Overall, 88 code patches were merged since the last
release.

## New Features and Improvements

-   Bodo is updated to use the latest versions of Numba, pandas and
    Arrow:

    -   Numba 0.51.2
    -   pandas 1.1.2
    -   Arrow 1.0.1

-   Major improvements in memory management. Bodo's memory consumption
    is reduced significantly by releasing memory as soon as possible in
    various operations such as Join, GroupBy, and Sort.

-   Significant improvements in checking and handling various errors in
    I/O, providing clear error messages and graceful exits.

-   Improvements in speed and scalability of `read_parquet`
    when reading from directories with large number of files.

-   Distributed diagnostics is improved to provide clear messages on why
    a variable was assigned REP distribution.

-   Improvements in caching support for I/O calls and groupby
    user-defined functions (UDFs).

-   Support for more distributed getitem/setitem cases on arrays.

-   Improvements on checking for unsupported functions and optional
    arguments.

    (e.g. `GroupBy.cumsum`).

-   Support for `axis=1` in `DataFrame.var/std`.

-   Support for `Series.autocorr`.

-   Support for `Series.is_monotonic_increasing/is_monotonic_decreasing`.

-   Support `pd.Series()` constructor with a scalar data
    value.

-   Support for `dayofweek`, `is_leap_year` and
    `days_in_month` in `Timestamp` and
    `Series.dt]{.title-ref}.

-   Support for `isocalendar` in `Series.dt` and
    `DatetimeIndex`.

-   Support for `Series.cumsum/cummin/cummax`.

-   Support for `Decimal` values in nested data structures.

-   Improvements in table join performance.

-   Support for `Series.drop_duplicates`.

-   Support for `np.dot` and `@` operator on
    `Series`.
