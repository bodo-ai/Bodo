### ✨ New Features

- Added Iceberg write support using `DataFrame.to_iceberg()`. Features include simple filesystem writes, partition spec, and sort order.
- Support writing Parquet files using `DataFrame.to_parquet()`.
- Added support for simple filesystem reads in `read_iceberg()`.
- Support for `DataFrame.groupby()` with aggregate functions including sum, count, and max.
- Support for DataFrameGroupBy and SeriesGroupBy `aggregate()`/`agg()`.
- Added 8 Series.str methods including `str.extract()` and `str.split()`, achieving Series.str method coverage of 96% (54 out of 56).
- Added 5 Series reduction methods including `Series.max()` and `Series.sum()`.
- Support for `pd.to_datetime()` and timedelta types/methods.
- Added top-level null check methods such as `pd.isnull()`.
- Support for Series `sort_values()`.
- Optimized support for `sort_values()` followed by `head()`.
- Support for DataFrame column renaming.
- Support for arithmetic expression on DataFrames, e.g., `df[“new_col”] = df[“A”] + df[“B”]`.
- Support for bodo.pandas.DataFrame/Series constructors.
- Support for filtering expressions on Series, e.g., `s[s > 10]`.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
