Bodo 2022.7 Release (Date: 07/31/2022) {#July_2022}
========================================

## New Features and Improvements

Compilation / Performance improvements:

- `Groupby` operations are now faster to compile and support super-wide DataFrames
- `Groupby.apply()` operations have improved compilation time, runtime memory usage and performance.
- Most `BodoSQL` select statements are now faster to compile.
- Cache is now automatically invalidated when upgrading Bodo.

Iceberg:

- Added support for writing Iceberg tables via `to_sql`

I/O:

- `to_csv`, `to_json`, and `to_parquet` now support a custom argument `_bodo_file_prefix` to specify the prefix of files written in distributed cases.
- Snowflake data load now supports filter pushdown with `Series.str.startswith` and `Series.str.endswith`.

Pandas coverage:

- `read_csv` and `read_json` now support argument `sample_nrows` to set the number of rows that are sampled to infer column dtypes (by default `sample_nrows=100`).
- Support for `DataFrame.rank`
- Support for `Groupby.ngroup`
- Added support for dictionary-encoded string arrays (that have reduced memory usage and execution time) in the following functions:
    - `Groupby.min`
    - `Groupby.max`
    - `Groupby.first`
    - `Groupby.last`
    - `Groupby.shift`
    - `Groupby.head`
    - `Groupby.nunique`
    - `Groupby.sum`

    - `Groupby.transform`

BodoSQL:

- Added support for the following query syntax
    - `QUALIFY`
    - `GROUP BY GROUPING SETS`

- Added support for the following windowed aggregation functions:
    - `RANK`
    - `DENSE_RANK`

    - `ASCII`
    - `CHAR`
    - `COALESCE`
    - `CONV`
    - `DAYNAME`
