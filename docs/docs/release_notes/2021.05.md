Bodo 2021.5 Release (Date: 5/19/2021) {#May_2021}
=====================================

This release includes many new features, optimizations, bug fixes and
usability improvements. Overall, 70 code patches were merged since the
last release.

## New Features and Improvements

-   Bodo is updated to use Arrow 4.0 (latest)

-   Connectors:

    -   Improved performance of `pd.read_parquet` significantly for
        large multi-file datasets by optimizing Parquet metadata
        collection
    -   Bodo nows reads only the first few rows from a Parquet dataset
        if the program only requires `df.head(n)` and/or `df.shape`.
        This helps with exploring large datasets without the need for
        a large cluster to load the full data in memory.

-   Visualization: Bodo now supports calling many Matplotlib plotting
    functions directly from JIT code. See the "Data Visualization"
    section of our documentation for more details. The current support
    gathers the data into one process but this will be avoided in future
    releases.

-   Improved compilation time for dataframe functions

-   Improved the performance and scalability of `groupby.nunique`

-   Many improvements to error checking and reporting

-   Bodo now avoids printing empty slices of distributed data to make
    print output easier to read.

-   Pandas coverage:

    -   Support for `DataFrame.info()`
    -   Support for `memory_usage()` for DataFrame and Series
    -   Support for `nbytes` for array and Index types
    -   Support for `df.describe()` with datetime data (assumes
        `datetime_is_numeric=True`)
    -   Support for `groupby.value_counts()`
    -   Support for `pd.NamedAgg` with `nunique` in groupby
    -   Initial support for CategoricalIndex type and categorical keys
        in groupby
    -   Support for groupby `idxmin` and `idxmax` with nullable
        Integer and Boolean arrays
    -   Support for timedelta64 in `Groupby.agg`
    -   Support for `bins` and other optional arguments in
        `Series.value_counts()`
    -   Support for `df.dtypes`
    -   Support passing `df.dtypes` to `df.astype()`, for example:
        `df1.astype(df2.dtypes)`
    -   Support for boolean `pd.Index`
    -   Support for `Series.sort_index()`
    -   Support for `Timestamp.day_name()` and `Series.dt.day_name()`
    -   Support for `Series.quantile()` with datetime
    -   Support for passing list of quantile values to
        `Series.quantile()`
    -   Support for `Series.to_frame()`
    -   Support for `sum()` method of Boolean Arrays
    -   Initial support for `MultiIndex.from_product`
    -   String array comparison returns a Pandas nullable boolean
        array instead of a Numpy boolean array
