    (ADLS)

-   

    Improved support for UDFs

    :   -   More robust user function handling
        -   Improved support for date/time data types in UDFs

-   

    Improved support for rolling window functions

    :   -   Support `raw` argument of `apply()`
        -   Support column selection from rolling objects
        -   Support for nullable int values

-   

    Pandas coverage:

    :   -   Support for `groupby.apply`

        -   Improved support for dataframe indexing using df.loc/iloc
        -   Improve dtype handling in `read_csv`
        -   Support for `Series.mask`
        -   Improved robustness for highly skewed string data (e.g. most
            of string data is on a few processes due to uneven data

        -   Support for dataframes with repeated column names
        -   Support for `datetime.date` arrays as Index in `pivot_table`
            and as argument to `pd.DatetimeIndex`
        -   Improved error checking in Pandas implementations
        -   Unroll constant loops for type stability in more cases

-   

    Numpy coverage:

    :   -   Support for `np.hstack`

-   

    Scikit-learn:

    :   -   Support for `sklearn.preprocessing.StandardScaler` inside
