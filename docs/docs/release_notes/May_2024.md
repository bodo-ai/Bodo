Bodo 2024.5 Release (Date: 5/3/2024) {#May_2024}
=====================================

### New Features:

- Added an environment variable `BODO_SQL_STYLE` to control some of the defaults for BodoSQL’s SQL dialect. The default is `SNOWFLAKE` which uses the Snowflake protocols for identifier case sensitivity and null ordering defaults. Another option for the environment variable is `SPARK` which uses spark’s defaults for identifier case sensitivity and null ordering defaults. The environment variable’s value is not case-sensitive.
- Added support for groupby sum of decimal values
- Added support for writing puffin files with Iceberg writes by setting `BODO_ENABLE_THETA_SKETCHES=1`. A future release will enable this by default.
- Added support for casting between decimal values with different precision and scale
- Added support for multiplication of two decimal scalars/arrays.
- Added support for `CREATE SCHEMA` and `DROP SCHEMA` commands in Iceberg and Snowflake


### Performance Improvements:

- Slightly reduced the total number of metadata queries made to Snowflake during compilation time to determine when a string column should be dictionary encoded by removing unnecessary/redundant requests.


### Bug Fixes:

- Fixed a bug that caused some Iceberg nullability filters to not be pushed down.
- Fixed a rarely occurring segfault when gathering a map array.
- Fixed an issue that caused an error while loading string columns from Snowflake managed Iceberg tables.
- Fixed some bugs in handling nested-types in joins.


### Dependency Upgrades:
- Upgraded to Iceberg 1.5.1


## 2024.5.1 New Features and Improvements


### New Features:
- Support `MIN` and `MAX` on string columns when GROUP BY is not provided.

### Bug Fixes:
- Adjusted BodoSQL compile-time Snowflake metadata requests to avoid an error due to changing formats of Snowflake result sets for certain description queries.
