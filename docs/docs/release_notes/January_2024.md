Bodo 2024.1 Release (Date: 01/05/2024) {#January_2024}
========================================

### New Features:

- Distributed complex, two dimensional fft and fftshift
- Added support for the function `TO_OBJECT`.
- Added support for `OUTER=>true` when calling `FLATTEN`.
- Support for creating a table with the `GENERATOR` function using only the `ROWCOUNT` argument.
- Increased support for variant arguments to numeric/datetime/string/array/object functions.
- Added support for `GET_PATH` and the alternate syntax using `:`
- Support ARRAY_AGG on all types.
- Setting the environment variable BODO_DISABLE_SF_RESULT_CACHE to 1 will ensure that Snowflake doesnâ€™t return results from its result cache when Bodo reads tables from Snowflake. This can be useful for performance testing but is not recommended for production use.


### Performance Improvements:

- General improvements to disk spilling performance
- General improvements to the spilling functionality for better memory utilization in Join and Groupby.
- Enabled several plan optimizations such as simplifying null predicates and push predicates deeper into the plan.

Bug Fixes:
- Coalesce type coercion now matches snowflake behavior
- `OBJECT_AGG` now omits any rows where the key or value is null in the final object.
- Fixed a bug where default Snowflake connection settings could cause a timeout for long running writes. We now set ABORT_DETACHED_QUERY=False automatically to avoid this issue.

### Usability Improvements

- Improved the specificity of error messages regarding Snowflake UDFs to help better explain limitations in Bodo functionality for UDFs. Future releases will expand this functionality.
- Using an aggregation function other than first on a semi-structured column now throws an error.
