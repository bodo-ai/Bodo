# Bodo 2025.9 Release (Date: 09/18/2025) {#September_2025}
### 🎉 Highlights

This release, we are excited to significantly improve the responsiveness of Bodo DataFrames with lazy JIT import, optimize performance with Common Table Expressions (CTEs), as well as upgrade to Arrow 21.

### ✨ New Features

- Getting length of BodoDataFrame or BodoSeries now returns a lazily evaluated BodoScalar.
- Add support for subset argument to drop_duplicates.

### 🏎️ Performance Improvements

- Support lazy BodoScalar binary operations for better optimizations.
- Recognize duplicate computations in execution trees and execute them only once using Common Table Expressions (CTEs).
- Support internal gather/scatter calls without JIT for faster response times.
- Support Iceberg read/write without JIT import for faster response times.

### ⚙️ Dependency Changes

- Upgraded Arrow dependency to 21.0.
