### üéâ Highlights

In this release, we are exited to add hooks for Bodo to accelerate User Defined Functions (UDFs) in Pandas. We also fixed several bugs related to our Pandas support in the compiler.

### ‚ú® New Features

 - Added hooks for accelerating Pandas UDFs with Bodo. Starting in Pandas 3.0, you will be able to use Bodo to automatically jit compile your UDFs and execute them over a DataFrame in parallel by passing `engine=bodo.jit` to `DataFrame.apply()`.

### üêõ Bug Fixes

 - Use Arrow for boxing/unboxing Datetime arrays.
 - Support passing an empty tuple as an argument to a function in Spawn-mode.
 - Support passing non-constant UDF `args` in `DataFrame.apply()`.
 - Support handling Pandas classes imported directly in the compiler.
