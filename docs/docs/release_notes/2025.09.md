# Bodo 2025.9 Release (Date: 09/18/2025) {#September_2025}
### 🎉 Highlights

This release, we are excited to significantly improve the import time of the Bodo package, as well as introduce new features like Series.where support and lazy BodoScalars.

### ✨ New Features

- Bodo DataFrames now imports the JIT compiler lazily only when necessary, which reduces import time substantially.
- Support for Series.where().
- Series reductions such as “sum” or “max” now produce a BodoScalar that is evaluated lazily and can be used in some operations such as Series.where() and filter expressions without execution.
- Optimized support for “not in series” cases like `df[~df.A.isin(df.B)]` using anti-join.
- Support for bodo.pandas uses inside JIT functions.
- Anthropic models used through AWS Bedrock now use Anthropic’s messages API to support newer versions of Claude.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- Fix for join non-equi condition keys that are not part of the output.
- Fix for Series expression with non-range Indexes.

### 🏎️ Performance Improvements

- Improved the initialization time for cfuncs used in the acceleration of user defined functions in Series.map and DataFrame.apply calls.

### ⚙️ Dependency Changes

- Added upper bound to Numba dependency to avoid issues with version 0.62.
