Bodo 2021.7 Release (Date: 7/23/2021) {#July_2021}
=====================================

This release includes many new features, optimizations, bug fixes and
usability improvements. Overall, 109 code patches were merged since the
last release.

## New Features and Improvements

-   Documentation has been reorganized and updated, with improved
    navigation and a detailed walkthrough of Pandas equivalents of
    PySpark functions.

-   Improvements to enable BodoSQL features

-   

    Connectors:

    :   -   Improved performance of `pd.read_parquet` when reading from
            remote storage systems like S3
        -   Support reading categorical columns of Parquet

-   

    Performance improvements:

    :   -   Improved performance and scalability of `sort_values`
        -   Optimized `pd.Series.isin(values)` performance for long list
            of `values`.

-   UDFs in Series.apply and Dataframe.apply: the Bodo compiler
    transforms the code to pass main function values referenced in the
    UDF ("free variables") as arguments to `apply()` automatically if
    possible (to simplify UDF usage).

-   Support passing Bodo data types to objmode directly (in addition to
    string representation of the data types). For example, the following
    code sets the return type an int64 type:

        @bodo.jit
        def f(a, b):
            with bodo.objmode(res=bodo.types.int64):
                res = random.randint(a, b)
            return res

-   Compilation time improvements for some dataframe operations

-   Distributed support for `pd.RangeIndex` calls

-   

    Pandas coverage:

    :   -   Initial support for binary arrays, including within
            series/dataframes

        -   Support for `groupby.transform`

        -   Groupby: support repeated input columns. For example:

                df.groupby("A").agg(
                        D=pd.NamedAgg(column="B", aggfunc=lambda A: A.sum()),
                        F=pd.NamedAgg(column="C", aggfunc="max"),
                        E=pd.NamedAgg(column="B", aggfunc="min"),
                )

        -   Support Groupby with `dropna=False`

        -   Support for `dropna` in `Series.nunique`,
            `DataFrame.nunique`, and `groupby.nunique`

        -   Support for `DataFrame.insert()`

        -   Support `tolist()` for string and numpy arrays

        -   

            Expanded `astype` support:

            :   -   str to timedelta64/datetime64
                -   timedelta64/datetime64 to int64
                -   date arrays
                -   Numeric-like inputs to datetime/timedelta
                -   Support for `pd.StringDtype()` in `astype`
                -   numeric-like to nullable integer types

        -   Support for `pd.Timestamp.now()`

        -   Support Timestamp in `pd.to_datetime`

        -   Support for Timestamp/Timedelta as the scalar value for a
            Series

        -   Support for `Series.dt.month_name`, `Timestamp.month_name`

        -   Support for min/max on timedelta64 series/arrays

-   

    Python coverage:

    :   -   Support for `bytes.fromhex()`
        -   Support for `bytes.__hash__`
        -   Support for `min` and `max` for string values
