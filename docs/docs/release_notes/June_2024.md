Bodo 2024.6 Release (Date: 6/3/2024) {#June_2024}
=====================================

### New Features:

* Added read support for Glue Catalogs in BodoSQL
* Added support for more DDL commands for both Snowflake and Iceberg:
    * `DESCRIBE VIEW` (requires view support in catalog)
    * `DROP VIEW`  (requires view support in catalog)
    * `ALTER TABLE ... RENAME TO`
    * `ALTER VIEW ... RENAME TO`  (requires view support in catalog)
    * `SHOW TERSE TABLES`
    * `SHOW TERSE VIEWS`  (requires view support in catalog)

* Added support for pushing down join filters into cache nodes and uses join filters to determine whether or not to keep cache nodes.
* Added support for casting strings to Decimal types



### Performance Improvements:

- Allowed limited support for streaming execution of window functions, particularly for `DENSE_RANK`.
- Allowed Join Filters to be pushed into Snowflake I/O calls, particularly when the build side of a join allows us to infer the minimum/maximum value of a join key.


### Bug Fixes:

- Allowed Tabular Catalog to use testing environment
- Handled trailing slashes in Tabular Catalog's REST URI when created through the Bodo Platform
- Enabled further decorrelation with builtin table functions


### Dependency Upgrades:
- Upgraded to Arrow 16
- Upgraded to Iceberg 1.5.2


## 2024.6.1

### New Features:

* Support min/max runtime join filters into Iceberg IO
* `DATE_TRUNC` now accepts `TIMESTAMPTZ` input
* The `DIFF_*` family of functions now support `TIMESTAMPTZ` input

### Improvements:

* Improves the memory manager to reduce the likelihood of out-of-memory errors in certain situations.
* Improved NDV estimates involving CASE expressions and IS NOT NULL filters.
* Runtime join filters are now applied in the order that's most likely to reduce intermediate costs.

### Bug Fixes:

* Fixed `ALTER TABLE RENAME TO` not being able to specify schemas or databases.
* `TIMESTAMPTZ` can be compared with other `TIMESTAMP` types in all contexts
* Fixed calling GROUP BY with keys that mixed LIST columns with other types
* Automatically casts the decimal input to a floating point type when computing DECIMAL * FLOAT
