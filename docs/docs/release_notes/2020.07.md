Bodo 2020.07 Release (Date: 07/16/2020) {#July_2020}
========================================

This release includes many new features and bug fixes. Overall, 59 code
patches were merged since the last release, including the major addition
of support for columns of array and struct values with arbitrary
nesting.

## New Features and Improvements

-   Bodo is updated to use the latest version of Numba (Numba 0.50.1)

-   Series and dataframe columns can have values that are arrays. For
    example:

        A          B
        0  0  [1, 2, 3]
        1  1     [4, 5]
        2  2        [6]
        3  3  [7, 8, 9]

-   Series and dataframe columns can have values that are structs. For
    example:

        A                   B
        0  0  {'A': 1, 'B': 2.1}
        1  1  {'A': 3, 'B': 4.3}
        2  2  {'A': 5, 'B': 6.5}
        3  3  {'A': 7, 'B': 8.4}

-   Array and Struct values can contain other arrays/structs with
    arbitrary nesting. For example:

        A                                     B
        0  0               {'A': [1, 2], 'B': [3]}
        1  1            {'A': [4, 5, 6], 'B': [7]}
        2  2  {'A': [8, 9, 10, 11], 'B': [12, 13]}
        3  3                {'A': [14], 'B': [15]}

-   `df.drop_duplicates()` and `df.merge()` is supported for nested
    array/struct columns.

-   Added support for *categorical* array data type without explicit
    categories. Added support for `Series.astype(cat_dtype)` and
    `Series.astype("category")`.

-   Generalized `df.dropna()` to all arrays, and added support for
    'how' and 'subset' options.

-   Support for `Series.explode()`

-   `series.median()`: support 'skipna' option and Decimal type, and
    bug fixes.

-   Added Series.radd/rsub/rmul/rdiv/rpow/rmod

-   Support for Series.dot/kurt/kurtosis/skew/sem

-   Added Series.mad (mean absolute deviation)

-   `Series.var()` and `Series.std()`: Added support for 'skipna' and
    'ddof' options

-   Support Series.equals

-   Series product/sum: added support for 'min_count' and 'skipna'
    options

-   Support Index.map() for all Index type

-   Support all Bodo array types as output of Series.map/apply, df.apply

-   Support df.values with nullable int columns

-   Bodo release builds now enforce licensing (expiration date and
    maximum core count) via license keys provided as a file or an
    environment variable called "BODO_LICENSE".
