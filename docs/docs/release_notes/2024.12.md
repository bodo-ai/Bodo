=====================================

We're excited to announce that Bodo is now open source with no restrictions!

Explore, contribute, and collaborate by accessing the codebase on [Github](https://github.com/bodo-ai/Bodo).

## 2024.12.1

### New Features

- Revamped and simplified examples
- Added NYC Taxi benchmark code for Bodo, Spark, Dask and Ray

### Bug Fixes

- Fix caching for IPython and Jupyter cells
- Fix BodoSQL use outside JIT in Jupyter
- Dependency Changes
- Upgrade to Arrow 18.1

### Docs

## 2024.12.2

### New Features

- Handle slicing with negative start/step in lazy DataFrame/Series wrappers

### Bug Fixes
- Fix DataFrame.to_json handling of “lines” and “orient” arguments
- Fix errors during exit related to logging of lazy data structures


## 2024.12.3

### New Features

- Adds a `@bodo.wrap_python` decorator for calling regular Python functions from JIT code. It is both easier to use and also much faster than objmode (doesn't require compilation during runtime). This interface fits the common UDF case for calling regular Python especially well.

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed an issue with objmode functionality used in nested UDF functions
- Fixed an issue with referencing global variables in objmode while using spawn mode
`scatterv`/`gatherv` now supports scattering/gathering larger data sizes
