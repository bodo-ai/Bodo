Bodo 2024.7 Release (Date: 7/9/2024) {#July_2024}
=====================================

### New Features:

* Added support for adding Decimal values.
* Added support for binary arithmetic operations between floats and Decimals.
* Added support for enabling and disabling theta sketches on specific columns by setting the table property `bodo.write.theta_sketch_enabled.<column_name>`.
* Added support for new DDL commands:
    * `ALTER TABLE RENAME COLUMN`
    * `ALTER TABLE ALTER COLUMN COMMENT`
    * `ALTER TABLE ALTER COLUMN DROP NOT NULL`
    * `DESCRIBE SCHEMA`
    * `SHOW TBLPROPERTIES`
    * `SHOW TABLES/VIEWS/SCHEMAS/OBJECTS` without `TERSE`

* (EXPERIMENTAL FEATURE) Added support for hints for indicating whether a join should be a broadcast join or for which side of a join should be the build side versus the probe side.
* (EXPERIMENTAL FEATURE) Added support for increased caching based on covering expressions.


### Performance Improvements:

* Expanded support for min/max I/O join filters to strings dates, floats, and timezone-naive timestamps.
* Added limited datatype support for pushing low-cardinality join filters into I/O when the build side of a join has a small number of unique keys but where min/max filters are not very useful.
* Added support for passing bitmasks in/out of runtime join filters to reduce the amount of redundant copying and improve performance when multiple join filters are applied in a row.
* Optimized decimal scalar/array multiplication.
* Added a sort based implementation for dense_rank.
* Improved cost based decisions for filters and projections.


### Bug Fixes:

* Fixed a bug occurring with join filters being pushed into Iceberg I/O on certain datatypes.
* Fixed a bug so `drop view / table if exists` no longer throws exceptions when the table/schema does not exist.
