Bodo 2024.11 Release (Date: 11/27/2024) {#November_2024}
=====================================

### New Features:

* `bodo.jit` will now use “spawn” mode by default, which allows Bodo JIT functions to be used in regular Python scripts without `mpiexec`. Bodo spawns worker MPI processes the first time a JIT function is called. For each JIT function, Bodo sends arguments, runs the function and returns the output to regular Python. Pandas DataFrames and Series have a lazy wrapper that collects the data only if necessary.
* Add support for `Series.str.encode`
* Several array types are boxed in Arrow format now

### Bug Fixes:

* Various bug fixes in the compiler
