### ‚ú® New Features

- Added support for [`pd.read_iceberg`](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/dev/reference/api/pandas.read_iceberg.html) (from Pandas 3.0 APIs). The implementation includes optimizations such as limit, projection, and filter pushdown as well as features such as time travel.
- Added initial support for `merge()` for the `how=‚Äùinner‚Äù` case.
- Added initial support for `sort_values()`.
- Added 46 Series.str methods such as `str.find()` and `str.partition()`.
- Added 30 Series.dt accessors and methods such as `dt.dayofweek` and `dt.is_month_start`.
- Added 7 Series methods including `Series.isin` and `Series.clip`.
- Improved support for arbitrarily complex DataFrame filter expressions and additional date/time types.
- Added same arbitrarily complex Series expression support.
- Added basic infrastructure for groupby, full support will be included in the next release.
- Improved execution time of DataFrame and Series `head()` calls.
- Improved performance of many computations substantially.


### üêõ Bug Fixes
