    `pd.DataFrame(X, columns=["y"] + ["x{}".format(i) for i in range(m)])`

-   Improvements in caching to cover missing cases

-   Pandas coverage:

    -   Support column indices in `read_csv()` `dtype` argument. For
        example: `df = pd.read_csv(fname, dtype={3: str})`
    -   Support for `df.to_string()`
    -   Initial support for `pd.Categorical()`
    -   Support `Series.min` and `Series.max` for categorical data
    -   Support `pd.to_datetime()` with categorical string input
    -   Support `pd.Series()` constructor without `data` argument
        specified
    -   Support `dtype="str"` in Series constructor
    -   Support for `Series.to_dict()`
    -   Support for `Series.between()`
    -   Support `Series.loc[]` setitem with boolean array index, such
        as `S.loc[idx] = val` where `idx` is a boolean array or Series
    -   Support dictionary input in `Series.map()`, such as
        `S.map({1.0: "A", 4.0: "DD"})`
    -   Support for `pd.TimedeltaIndex` min and max
    -   Support for `pd.tseries.offsets.Week`

-   Numpy coverage:

    -   Support `axis=1` in distributed `np.concatenate`
    -   Initial support for `np.random.multivariate_normal`

-   Scikit-learn:

    -   Add `coef_` attribute to SGDClassifier model.
    -   Add `coef_` attribute to LinearRegression model.
    -   Support for `sklearn.preprocessing.LabelEncoder` inside jit
        functions.
    -   Support for `sklearn.metrics.r2_score` inside jit functions.
