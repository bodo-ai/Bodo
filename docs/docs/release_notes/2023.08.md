Bodo 2023.8 Release (Date: 08/31/2023) {#August_2023}
====================================================

## New Features and Improvements

Bodo:
- Vectorized query engine:

  Several operations (join and reads) now operate in 'vectorized'
  mode. Only results that are in use are kept in memory or read
  in. This leads to drastically improved memory performance and avoids
  OOM errors in many cases. There is a slight performance degradation
  in this mode, but this will improve with coming releases.

  Some operations, such as GROUP BY and window functions are not yet
  vectorized.

  Vectorized execution mode can be disabled by setting the environment variable `BODO_STREAMING_ENABLED` to `"0"`.

- Common subcolumn elimination in planner
- Better selectivity in metadata pushdown query
- Better type size estimates in planner
- Support `ignore_index=True` in `df.drop_duplicates`

BodoSQL:

Added support for the following functions:

- PERCENTILE_CONT
- SHA2
- MD5

Parity improvements:

Planner improvements:

- Improved planner based common sub-expression elimination
