# Configuring Customer Managed VPC {#customer_managed_vpc}

## Overview
In a Bodo Managed VPC, Bodo creates and manages the VPC in your AWS account. 
You can optionally create your Bodo workspaces in your own VPC, a feature known as customer-managed VPC. 
You can use a customer-managed VPC to have more control over your network configurations to comply with specific cloud security and governance standards your organization may require.
Your workspace must use a customer-managed VPC to configure it to use AWS PrivateLink for any type of connection.

A customer-managed VPC is good solution if you have:

* Security policies that prevent PaaS providers from creating VPCs in your own AWS account.

* An approval process to create a new VPC, in which the VPC is configured and secured in a well-documented way by internal information security or cloud engineering teams.
