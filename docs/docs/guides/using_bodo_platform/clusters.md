# Creating a Cluster {#creating_clusters}

Clusters are the compute resources that you can use to run your Bodo code in your workspace. This guide explains how to create a cluster on the Bodo Cloud Platform.
In the left bar, click on _Clusters_ (or click on the second step in the
_Onboarding_ list). This action will take you to the _Clusters_ page. At the top right corner,
click `Create Cluster,` which opens the cluster creation form.

### Cluster Basic Configuration

![Cluster-Form](../../platform2-gifs/create_cluster_form.gif#center)

#### Cluster Name

Choose a name for your cluster.

#### Instance type

Select the type of nodes in the cluster to be created from the dropdown list.
[EFA](https://aws.amazon.com/hpc/efa/){target="blank"} will be used if the instance type supports it.

![Cluster-Form-Instance](../../platform2-gifs/create_cluster_list.gif#center)

!!! note
    If the **Instance type** dropdown list does not populate,
    either the credentials are not entered properly or they are not valid.
    Please see how to set your [AWS][setting_aws_credentials]
    or [Azure][setting_azure_credentials] credentials and make sure your credentials are valid.

#### Use Spot Instances

This option enables spot instances in the cluster. Use this option to reduce the cost of VMs.

!!! note
    However, it's important to note that selecting this option can also have some drawbacks. 
    For further insights, please refer to the breakdowns associated with AWS and Azure spot instances.
    [Azure Spot](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/virtual-machines/spot), [AWS Spot](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/spot/)

#### Number of Instances

This option specifies the number of nodes in your cluster.

#### Bodo Version 

This option specifies the Bodo version to be installed on your cluster. 
Typically, the three latest Bodo Releases are available.

#### Cluster Auto Pause

This is the amount of time of inactivity after which the platform will pause the cluster automatically.

### Cluster Advanced Configuration
Additionally, you can specify the following advanced configuration options for cluster.

![Cluster-Form-Advanced](../../platform2-screenshots/cluster_advanced.png#center)

#### Availability Zone

:fontawesome-brands-aws: On AWS only

Select the availability zone where you want to deploy your cluster. By default, this is set to `Auto Select`.

#### Auto Stop 

Activity is determined through attached notebooks (see
[how to attach a notebook to a cluster][attaching_notebook_to_cluster]) and jobs
(see [how to run a job][running-a-batch-job]). Therefore, if you
don't plan to attach a notebook or a job to this cluster (and use it
via `ssh` instead), we recommend that you to set this to
`Never,` since otherwise, the cluster will be stopped after
the set time.

#### Instance Role 

:fontawesome-brands-aws: On AWS only 

Is the instance role that should be attached to the cluster instances. 
You can define these in Settings. By default, a new role will be created and attached.

#### Cluster description 

Description for the cluster.

### Cluster Instance Type and Size Recommendations
If you were previously running a query on a Snowflake Warehouse this table provides a starting point for what
instance type and size you can use to run the query using Bodo. Since this is only a starting point you should
experiment to find the best configuration for your specific use case.

| Snowflake Warehouse Size | Bodo Cluster Spec |
|--------------------------|-------------------|
| 2X-Small                 | 1 x i4i.xlarge    |
| X-Small                  | 1 x i4i.2xlarge   |
| Small                    | 1 x i4i.4xlarge   |
| Medium                   | 1 x i4i.8xlarge   |
| Large                    | 1 x i4i.16xlarge  |
| X-Large                  | 1 x i4i.32xlarge  |
| 2X-Large                 | 2 x i4i.32xlarge  |
| 3X-Large                 | 4 x i4i.32xlarge  |
| 4X-Large                 | 8 x i4i.32xlarge  |
| 5X-Large                 | 16 x i4i.32xlarge |
| 6X-Large                 | 32 x i4i.32xlarge |

### Monitoring the Cluster Creation Status

Once you have filled in all the required click on `CREATE`. You will see that a new task for creating the
cluster has been created. The status is updated to <inpg>INPROGRESS</inpg> when the task starts executing and
cluster creation is in progress.

![Cluster-Status-InProgress](../../platform2-screenshots/cluster_inprogress.png#center)

You can click on the `Details` drop-down to monitor the progress of the
cluster creation.

![Cluster-Info](../../platform2-screenshots/cluster_inprogress_deatails.png#center)

Once the cluster is successfully created and ready to use, the status is
updated to <fin>RUNNING</fin>.
