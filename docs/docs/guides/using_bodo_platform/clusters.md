# Creating a Cluster {#creating_clusters}

Clusters are the compute resources that you can use to run your Bodo code in your workspace. This guide explains how to create a cluster on the Bodo Cloud Platform.
In the left bar, click on _Clusters_ (or click on the second step in the
_Onboarding_ list). This action will take you to the _Clusters_ page. At the top right corner,
click `Create Cluster,` which opens the cluster creation form.

### Cluster Basic Configuration

![Cluster-Form](../../platform2-gifs/create_cluster_form.gif#center)

#### Cluster Name

Choose a name for your cluster.

#### Instance type

Select the type of nodes in the cluster to be created from the dropdown list.
[EFA](https://aws.amazon.com/hpc/efa/){target="blank"} will be used if the instance type supports it.

![Cluster-Form-Instance](../../platform2-gifs/create_cluster_list.gif#center)

!!! note
    If the **Instance type** dropdown list does not populate,
    either the credentials are not entered properly or they are not valid.
    Please see how to set your [AWS][setting_aws_credentials]
    or [Azure][setting_azure_credentials] credentials and make sure your credentials are valid.

#### Use Spot Instances

This option enables spot instances in the cluster. Use this option to reduce the cost of VMs.

![Cluster-Spot-Instance](../../platform2-screenshots/use_spot_instance.png#center)

!!! note
    However, it's important to note that selecting this option can also have some drawbacks. 
    For further insights, please refer to the breakdowns associated with AWS and Azure spot instances.
    [Azure Spot](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/virtual-machines/spot), [AWS Spot](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/spot/)

#### Number of Instances

This option specifies the number of nodes in your cluster.

#### Automatic Version Upgrade

This option enables automatic Bodo version upgrades. 
The cluster will automatically select the latest Bodo version during each cluster creation or restart. 
If you want to use a specific Bodo version, please deselect this option and specify the version in the `advanced` tab.
Typically, the three latest Bodo Releases are available.

#### Cluster Auto Pause / Auto Stop

**Cluster Auto Pause** is the period of inactivity after which the platform will automatically pause the cluster. 
Activity is based on attached notebooks and jobs.

**Cluster Auto Stop** is the period of inactivity after which the platform will automatically stop the cluster. 
This will remove VMs with storage but leave a reference in the Bodo Platform, allowing the cluster to be restarted.

!!! note
    In both cases, activity is determined by [attached notebooks][attaching_notebook_to_cluster] and [jobs][running-a-batch-job]. 
    If you don’t plan to attach a notebook or job (and will use SSH instead), it’s recommended to set this to ‘Never.’ 
    Otherwise, the cluster will be stopped or paused after the specified time

#### Cluster Tags

This option allows the user to specify additional tags that can be used to find resources in your cloud.

### Cluster Advanced Configuration
Additionally, you can specify the following advanced configuration options for cluster.

![Cluster-Form-Advanced](../../platform2-gifs/cluster_advanced.gif#center)

#### Availability Zone

:fontawesome-brands-aws: On AWS only

Select the availability zone where you want to deploy your cluster. By default, this is set to `Auto Select`.

#### Instance Role 

:fontawesome-brands-aws: On AWS only 

Is the instance role that should be attached to the cluster instances. 
You can define these in Settings. By default, a new role will be created and attached.

#### Bodo Version

This option specifies the Bodo version to be installed on your cluster.

#### Cluster description 

Description for the cluster.

### Cluster Instance Type and Size Recommendations
If you were previously running a query on a Snowflake Warehouse this table provides a starting point for what
instance type and size you can use to run the query using Bodo. Since this is only a starting point you should
experiment to find the best configuration for your specific use case.

| Snowflake Warehouse Size | Bodo Cluster Spec |
|--------------------------|-------------------|
| 2X-Small                 | 1 x i4i.xlarge    |
| X-Small                  | 1 x i4i.2xlarge   |
| Small                    | 1 x i4i.4xlarge   |
| Medium                   | 1 x i4i.8xlarge   |
| Large                    | 1 x i4i.16xlarge  |
| X-Large                  | 1 x i4i.32xlarge  |
| 2X-Large                 | 2 x i4i.32xlarge  |
| 3X-Large                 | 4 x i4i.32xlarge  |
| 4X-Large                 | 8 x i4i.32xlarge  |
| 5X-Large                 | 16 x i4i.32xlarge |
| 6X-Large                 | 32 x i4i.32xlarge |

### Monitoring the Cluster Creation Status

Once you have filled in all the required click on `CREATE`. You will see that a new task for creating the
cluster has been created. The status is updated to <inpg>INPROGRESS</inpg> when the task starts executing and
cluster creation is in progress.

![Cluster-Status-InProgress](../../platform2-screenshots/cluster_inprogress.png#center)

Once the cluster is successfully created and ready to use, its status will be updated to <fin>RUNNING</fin>. 
You can click on the Details drop-down to view more information.
