# Bodo Pandas API (bodo.pandas)

The bodo.pandas library is designed to scale Pandas workflows with just a one-line change â€” simply replace:

``` py
import pandas as pd
```

with

``` py
import bodo.pandas as pd
```

and your existing code can immediately take advantage of high-performance, scalable execution.

Key features include:

- __Full Pandas API compatibility__ with a transparent fallback mechanism to native Pandas, ensuring that your workflows continue uninterrupted even if a feature is not yet supported.

- __Lazy evaluation of operations__, allowing powerful optimizations like filter pushdown and column pruning behind the scenes.

- __Scalable MPI-based execution__, leveraging HPC (High-Performance Computing) techniques for efficient parallelism; whether you're working on a laptop or running jobs across a large cloud cluster.

- __Vectorized execution__ with streaming and spill-to-disk capabilities, making it possible to process datasets larger than memory reliably.

!!! warning
    `bodo.pandas` is under active development and is currently considered experimental. Some features and APIs may not yet be fully supported. We welcome your feedbackâ€”please join our community Slack or open an issue on GitHub if you encounter any problems!

## Lazy Evaluation and Fallback to Pandas

`bodo.pandas` operates with lazy evaluation, meaning operations are recorded into a query plan rather than executed immediately. Execution is automatically triggered only when results are actually needed, such as when displaying the first 5 rows in a DataFrame with `print(df.head(5))`.

If the user code encounters an unsupported Pandas API or an unsupported parameter, `bodo.pandas` gracefully falls back to native Pandas. When this happens, the query plan is immediately executed, the resulting data is collected onto a single core and converted to a Pandas DataFrame, and further operations proceed using Pandas.

!!! warning
    Fallback to Pandas may lead to degraded performance and increase the risk of out-of-memory (OOM) errors, especially for large datasets.

## General Functions

### bodo.pandas.from_pandas
``` py
bodo.pandas.from_pandas(df: pandas.DataFrame) -> BodoDataFrame
```

Converts a Pandas DataFrame into a lazy BodoDataFrame.

#### Parameters
: __df__ : __*pandas.DataFrame*__: A Pandas DataFrame.


#### Returns
: __BodoDataFrame__: A lazy BodoDataFrame.

#### Examples

``` py
import pandas as pd
import bodo.pandas as bodo_pd

df = pd.DataFrame(
        {
            "a": [1, 2, 3, 7] * 2,
            "b": [4, 5, 6, 8] * 2,
            "c": ["a", "b", None, "abc"] * 2,
        },
    )

bdf = bodo_pd.from_pandas(df)
```

### bodo.pandas.read_parquet
``` py
bodo.pandas.read_parquet(
    path,
    engine="auto",
    columns=None,
    storage_options=None,
    use_nullable_dtypes=lib.no_default,
    dtype_backend=lib.no_default,
    filesystem=None,
    filters=None,
    **kwargs,
) -> BodoDataFrame
```

Creates a lazy DataFrame object for reading from parquet file(s).

#### Parameters
: __path__ : __*str, path object or file-like object*__: Location(s) of the parquet file(s). Refer to [Pandas documentation for more details](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.read_parquet.html#pandas.read_parquet).

!!! warning
    The following parameters will trigger a fallback to [pandas.read_parquet](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.read_parquet.html#pandas.read_parquet) if a value other than the default is provided: __engine__, __columns__, __storage_options__, __use_nullable_dtypes__, __dtype_backend__, __filesystem__, __filters__, __**kwargs__


#### Returns
: __BodoDataFrame__: A lazy BodoDataFrame.
