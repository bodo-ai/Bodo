# pd.read_csv

`pandas.read_csv`

-   [example usage and more system specific instructions][csv-section]
`filepath_or_buffer` should be a string and is required. It
    could be pointing to a single CSV file, or a directory
    containing multiple partitioned CSV files (must have `csv` file
    extension inside directory).
-   Arguments `sep`, `delimiter`, `header`, `names`, `index_col`,
    `usecols`, `dtype`, `nrows`, `skiprows`, `chunksize`,
    `parse_dates`, and `low_memory` are supported.
-   Argument `anon` of `storage_options` is supported for S3
    filepaths.
-   Either `names` and `dtype` arguments should be provided to
    enable type inference, or `filepath_or_buffer` should be
    inferrable as a constant string. This is required so bodo can
    infer the types at compile time, see [compile time constants][require_constants]
-   `names`, `usecols`, `parse_dates` should be constant lists.
-   `dtype` should be a constant dictionary of strings and types.
-   `skiprows` must be an integer or list of integers and if it is
    not a constant, `names` must be provided to enable type
    inference.
-   `chunksize` is supported for uncompressed files only.
-   `low_memory` internally process file in chunks while parsing. In
    Bodo this is set to `False` by default.
-   When set to `True`, Bodo parses file in chunks but
    like Pandas the entire file is read into a single DataFrame
    regardless.
-   If you want to load data in chunks, use the `chunksize`
    argument.
-   When a CSV file is read in parallel (distributed mode) and each
    process reads only a portion of the file, reading columns that
    contain line breaks is not supported.
-   `_bodo_read_as_dict` is a Bodo specific argument which forces 
    the specified string columns to be read with dictionary-encoding.
    Dictionary-encoding stores data in memory in an efficient
    manner and is most effective when the column has many repeated values.

    For example:
    ```py
    @bodo.jit
    def impl(f):
      df = pd.read_csv(f, _bodo_read_as_dict=["A", "B", "C"])
      return df
    ```
