# NOT BETWEEN



The `#!sql BETWEEN` operator selects values within a given range. The
values can be numbers, text, or datetimes. The `#!sql BETWEEN` operator
is inclusive: begin and end values are included:
```sql
SELECT <COLUMN_NAMES>
FROM <TABLE_NAME>
WHERE <COLUMN_NAME> BETWEEN <VALUE1> AND <VALUE2>
```
For example:
```sql
SELECT A FROM table1 WHERE A BETWEEN 10 AND 100
```
### Example Usage
```py
>>>@bodo.jit
... def g(df):
...    bc = bodosql.BodoSQLContext({"CUSTOMERS":df})
...    query = "SELECT name, balance FROM customers WHERE balance BETWEEN 1000 and 5000"
...    res = bc.sql(query)
...    return res

>>>@bodo.jit
... def g2(df):
...    bc = bodosql.BodoSQLContext({"CUSTOMERS":df})
...    query = "SELECT name, balance FROM customers WHERE balance NOT BETWEEN 100 and 10000"
...    res = bc.sql(query)
...    return res

>>>customers_df = pd.DataFrame({
...     "CUSTOMERID": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9],
...     "NAME": ["Deangelo Todd","Nikolai Kent","Eden Heath", "Taliyah Martinez",
...                 "Demetrius Chavez","Weston Jefferson","Jonathon Middleton",
...                 "Shawn Winters","Keely Hutchinson", "Darryl Rosales",],

... })

>>>g1(payment_df) # BETWEEN
            NAME  BALANCE
0  Deangelo Todd  1123.34
