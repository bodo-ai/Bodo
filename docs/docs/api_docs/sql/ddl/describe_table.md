# DESCRIBE TABLE

Describes either the columns in a table or the current values, as well as the default values, for the stage properties for a table.

See the [Snowflake documentation](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/desc-table) for more details.

Currently, BodoSQL only supports the following syntax:

```sql
DESC[RIBE] TABLE <name>
```
