# SHOW SCHEMAS

Lists the schemas for which you have access privileges for a specified database.

See the [Snowflake documentation](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/show-schemas) for more details.

Currently, BodoSQL only supports the following syntax:

```sql
SHOW TERSE SCHEMAS IN <database_name>
```
