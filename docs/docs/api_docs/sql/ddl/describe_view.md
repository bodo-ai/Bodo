# DESCRIBE VIEW

Describes the columns in a view.

This function can also be used to describe the columns in a table.

See the [Snowflake documentation](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/desc-view) for more details.

Currently, BodoSQL only supports the following syntax:

```sql
DESC[RIBE] VIEW <name>
```
