# for more information.

# This script needs to be run in bodo sources top-level directory. The script:
# - Modifies RPATH of .so libraries in Bodo:
#     1) clears the existing RPATH
#     2) Adds mpi4py_mpich.libs directory with relative path to RPATH
#        and point to the libmpi-XXX.so.a.b.c contained there
#     3) Add bodo.libs with relative path to the RPATH (ssl libraries are there,
#         bundled by `auditwheel repair`)
#     4) Undo the changes made by auditwheel repair that refer to Arrow libraries
# - Removes libmpi and any arrow libraries from the contents of Bodo package

# XXX Maybe it's better to do all of this as part of `auditwheel repair`, but
# it would require [monkey]patching it
