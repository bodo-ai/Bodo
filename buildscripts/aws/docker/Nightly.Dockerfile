# This docker image is VERY LARGE, so we remove unnecessary files
# after the environment is created. This will increase the docker
# image size because it creates layers, so we use docker-squash
# https://pypi.org/project/docker-squash/ to generate a new
# smaller image.
# TODO: Determine if there are more files that can be removed
# i.e. source files that are compiled.
