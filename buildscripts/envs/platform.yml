# Platform Specific Dependencies
# Even though we use these dependencies in the main lockfile,
# we have a second lockfile in buildscripts/envs/platform/conda-lock.yml
# because we don't want dev dependencies on the platform. Right now, conda-lock
# has issues with multiple categories, so we can't use 1 lockfile.
# Once https://github.com/conda/conda-lock/pull/390 is merged and released,
# we can delete the platform lockfile and use the main lockfile for both
