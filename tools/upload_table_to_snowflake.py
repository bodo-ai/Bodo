"""
This script can be used as part of the procedure to upload a DataFrame of data to our Snowflake
account (specifically in TEST_DB.PUBLIC). To do so, follow the steps below in order:

1. Convert your DataFrame to a parquet file located in the same folder as this script. For example,
   if you have a DataFrame `df`, you can use `df.to_parquet("new_table.pq", index=False)` to write it
   to a parquet file named "new_table.pq".

2. Export the Snowflake credentials into your local environment as SF_USERNAME and SF_PASSWORD. To find
   which values to use, look in 1Password for the "Snowflake (bodopartner.us-east-1)" credentials. For
   ease of debugging errors, it is preferred to also run `export BODO_SF_DEBUG_LEVEL=1`.

3. Log into the Snowflake UI for our account (https://bodopartner.us-east-1.snowflakecomputing.com/) using
   those same credentials, and use the UI to create a new table with the desired name, column names, and
   column types. For example, if I wanted to create the table with the name OMEGA_SIX and columns
   alpha, beta, and gamma with types integer, string, and date (the types of which should match the
   types from `df` in step #1), I would use the following command in Snowflake:

    `CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE OMEGA_SIX(alpha INTEGER, beta VARCHAR, gamma DATE);`

     *** Make sure the current default database is TEST_DB, and the default schema is PUBLIC ***

    If you are unsure what types to use, copy the function get_schema lower in the file
    into the same python process where you ran `df.to_parquet(...)` and call
    get_schema(df) to learn what Snowflake types should be used.

4. Immediately after creating the table, run a command to ensure that SYSADMIN has access to
   the newly created table. If you ever re-run the `CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE` command, you will need to
   re-run this command. For the table above, this will look as follows:

   `GRANT OWNERSHIP ON OMEGA_SIX TO SYSADMIN;`

5. At the bottom of this script, change the strings in lines to use the names of the parquet file and
   table name you created in Snowflake:

    parquet_file_path = "new_table.pq"
    snowflake_table_name = "OMEGA_SIX"

6. Run this Python file: python upload_table_to_snowflake.py. When you are done and sure everything worked,
   undo the changes from step #5.

7. To confirm everything worked, go back to the Snowflake UI and try examining the data from the table,
   e.g. `SELECT * FROM OMEGA_SIX;`. If you see an error message, it could mean one of the following:
   - The table was not created in Snowflake.
   - The column types in Snowflake were provided incorrectly.
   - You did not run the GRANT OWNERSHIP command on the most recent version of the table.
   - The snowflake credentials were exported incorrectly.
