/**
 * This class is the entry point for all Python code that relates to planner driven operations.
 * Each method in this class should be a static method so that it can be cleanly called from Python
 * without relying on any method behavior.
 *
 * The motivation behind this is three-fold:
 * 1. By adding an explicit Python interface it allows common IDE
 * operations (e.g. dead code detection) to be performed on all the
 * "core" files except for the Python entry point files.
 * 2. It ensures that any of the internal functionality can be defined as
 * "package private". Anything exposed to Python must be public.
 * 3. It defines an explicit interface between Python and Java, rather than
 * depending on Py4J's support for Java method calls. This means if we ever
 * want to switch a proper "service", then these APIs are much easier to
 * support.
