/**
 * Represents the cost of a relational operation.
 *
 * The cost is composed of the cpu, io, and mem used to complete an operation.
 * If a resource is divided between multiple processing units, the cost would be
 * the usage of each processing unit. As an example, a parallel operation
 * might be divided by the number of ranks it can effectively utilize so an operation
 * that uses two ranks effectively costs half for the same operation that uses
 * one rank.
 *
 * The row count for an operation is included as part of the cost, but is
 * not used for cost comparisons.
