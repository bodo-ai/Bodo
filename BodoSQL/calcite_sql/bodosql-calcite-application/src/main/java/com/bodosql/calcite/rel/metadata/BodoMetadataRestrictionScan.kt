/**
 * Pre-scans a query plan to determine which columns should be allowed to have their
 * approximate distinct counts requested from Snowflake. This includes columns that
 * are used as join conditions, but also any columns used as grouping keys or in
 * a SELECT DISTINCT if the output later becomes an input to a join, since the number
 * of rows produced affects the cost of a join.
 *
 * Applying this restriction allows us to prevent the planner from requesting metadata
 * from Snowflake every time we see an aggregation or a SELECT DISTINCT, since there is
 * no point in approximating their row counts.
 *
 * [BSE-1572] TODO: investigate potential usage of RelMdExpressionLineage for this purpose.
 * [BSE-1607] TODO: unify getEquiJoinConditions with the actual logic we use in the
 *            join row counts calculations to reduce our technical debt & ensure that
 *            updating one automatically updates the other.
 * [BSE-1608] TODO: investigate moving the storage of which columns can be requested into
 *            the tables themselves, and potentially have all of the metadata requests come
 *            at the end of the scan so they can be done in batches.
 * [BSE-1609] TODO: altering the conditions under which an aggregation is allowed to request
 *            the metadata for its keys so that stranger join cases don't result in the
 *            aggregation not realizing that it is a descendant of a join.
