    This rule matches on any project that simply returns it's child without performing any aliasing. This is determined by two functions,
    RexUtil.isIdentity (a calcite function), and isAlias (a function we defined).

    On a successful match, the project will be removed from the tree.

    This is a rule we reimplemented ourselves, in order to deal with aliasing issues. The code can be found at:
