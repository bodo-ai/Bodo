    """fixture that supplies queries for the filter_aggregate_transpose rule

    This rule matches on any Filter, whose input is exactly one aggregation.

    This rule will try to push as many filter conditions past an aggregation as it is able. It will not,
    for example, push any filters on columns that get aggregated, as such changes may effect the results of the
    aggregation.

    For example, assume a filter, "A" is on top of a aggregation "B". A has two conditions,
    one of which can be pushed, and the other can't. The end result after this optimization will
    be one filter, "A0" with the unpushed condition on top of aggregation "B" whose input is filtered
    by "A1", the filter with the pushed condition.
