    This rule matches on any project, whose input is a exactly one other project.

    This rule will do nothing to projections that are simply an identity,
    as it expects ProjectRemoveRule (another optimization (the one we replaced)) to remove those projections.

    This runs by default, as even in the un-optimized case we still seem to see this optimization occur. So, the only way
    to get this optimization to occur is in conjunction with project join transpose
