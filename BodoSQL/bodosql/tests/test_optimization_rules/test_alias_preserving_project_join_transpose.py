    """fixture that supplies queries for the project join transpose rule

    This rule matches on any project that has a join for a child.

    On a successful match, the project will determine which columns originate from the left table of the join, and which originate in the right
    It will then create a projection on the left/right tables that returns only the columns used in the join. These projections on top of the
    left/right table will not perform the proper aliasing. Therefore if the original projection aliases, the rule will leave a projection on top of the join,
    that does the proper aliasing. Ideally, we would like the projections that are pushed onto the left/right table to do the proper aliasing, and ommit
    the projection on top, as the projection on top often prevents any other nodes from being pushed past the join.

    This is a rule we reimplemented ourselves, in order to deal with aliasing issues, Source code can be found at:
