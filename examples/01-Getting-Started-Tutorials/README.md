# Getting started with Bodo

These notebooks are a great place to start by getting yourself familiar with how to use `bodo.jit` to automatically parallelize your python code with minimal effort. 

For a demonstration of the bodo jit compiler that can be run right after installing Bodo, see [monte_carlo_simulation.ipynb](monte_carlo_simulation.ipynb)

For a demonstration of how you can get started using Bodo to run SQL queries and do feature engineering using your favorite pandas APIs, see [quikcstart_notebook.ipynb](quikcstart_notebook.ipynb).
