# Let's Learn Bodo through Examples!

This is where you can find examples to help you get started using Bodo.

Bodo is a cutting-edge compute engine that brings high-performance computing (HPC) speed
and scalability to Python data and AI programs. Powered by an innovative auto-parallelizing
just-in-time (JIT) compiler, Bodo transforms Python programs into highly optimized,
parallel binaries without requiring code rewrites.

This repository teaches you to use Bodo effectively through examples.
If you know Python and SQL, you already know how to use Bodo, and you don't need any new language or API. You will just `import bodo` and learn some programming tricks to improve your existing applications to run faster and reduce compute resources while delivering value in a much shorter time-frame. Benchmarks have shown that Bodo can be orders of magnitude faster than other engines like Spark.


## How to run these examples?

You can also run these examples locally by [installing bodo](https://docs.bodo.ai/latest/installation_and_setup/install/#install) on your laptop.
