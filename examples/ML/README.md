# Using bodo to accelerate ML workloads

This module contains some examples using scikit-learn for machine learning. 
To run these examples, you will need to sign in with your AWS account to access public data on S3. You can do this using aws-cli by running
``` shell
aws configure
```


Open any of the notebooks and run it.

Watch your [htop](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/htop) in terminal and enjoy
all your CPU cores working hard on ML problems!

```shell
htop
```
