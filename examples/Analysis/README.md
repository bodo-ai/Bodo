# Data Analysis Examples

This folder contains various examples and scripts for performing data analysis using Bodo. Each example demonstrates different aspects of data processing and analysis, showcasing the capabilities and performance of Bodo in handling large datasets efficiently.

## Examples

### 1. `retail_analytics_clustering.ipynb` 
Accelerating Pandas based retail consumer clustering.
- **Description:** This Jupyter Notebook implements a retail analytics task (TPCxBB Q26) using Bodo's Pandas support. It clusters customers based on their in-store book purchasing history, demonstrating Bodo's ability to handle data analysis workloads.
- **Bodo Benefits:** This shows Bodo's compatibility with Pandas, a core data science library. It provides a practical example of how Bodo can accelerate common data analysis and manipulation tasks, like joining, filtering, grouping and aggregation, on larger datasets.
