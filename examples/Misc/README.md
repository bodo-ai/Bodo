# Miscellaneous Examples

This folder contains a collection of miscellaneous examples for Bodo. These examples demonstrate various features and use cases of the Bodo framework. 

## Examples

### 1. `misc_pi.py` 
PI Speed Test.

- **Description:**  A simple script that calculates Pi using a Monte Carlo method, accelerated with Bodo. It's used for testing Bodo's conda package installation.

- **Bodo Benefits:** It's a basic "hello world" example for Bodo, showing a simple numerical computation that benefits from parallelization.  It also has practical implications for testing the installation

### 2. `misc_word_count.py` 
Speeding Basic Data Processing Tasks.

- **Description:** A basic word count example that reads text data, performs simple preprocessing (lowercasing, splitting), and counts word frequencies, using Bodo for acceleration.

- **Bodo Benefits:**  It's another simple example showing how Bodo can speed up basic data processing tasks, specifically string manipulation and counting, that are foundational to many NLP workflows.
