    "### Pi Calculation using Monte Carlo Simulation\n",
    "One of the classic examples for parallel compute engines is the calculation of pi through Monte Carlo simulation. In this example we will:\n",
    "1. Run Monte Carlo simulation through Python\n",
    "2. Run Monte Carlo simulation through Bodo\n",
    "3. Increase the size of the simulation and run with Bodo.\n",

    "At the end, we compare the execution times and see that Bodo is much faster. This is the power of bodo's compiler along with MPI/SPMD as part of the compute engine.\n"
