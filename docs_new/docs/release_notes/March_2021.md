Bodo 2021.3 Release (Date: 3/25/2021) {#March_2021}
=====================================

This release includes many new features, bug fixes and usability
improvements. Overall, 148 code patches were merged since the last
release.

## New Features and Improvements

-   Bodo is updated to use Numba 0.53 (latest) and support Python 3.9

-   Many improvements to error checking and reporting

-   Compilation time is reduced, especially for user-defined functions
    (UDFs)

-   Reduced initialization time when importing Bodo

-   Distributed diagnostics improvements:

    -   Show distributed diagnostics when raising errors for
        distributed flag
    -   Only show user defined variables in diagnostics level one

-   Performance optimizations:

    -   Faster groupby `nunique` with improved scaling
    -   Faster `setitem` for categorical arrays

-   Connectors:

    -   Google Cloud Storage (GCS) support with Parquet
    -   Support reading Delta Lake tables
    -   Improved Snowflake support
    -   Removed s3fs dependency (Bodo now fully relies on Apache Arrow
        for S3 connectivity)

-   Change default parallelism semantics of `unique()` to replicated
    output to match user expectations better

-   Support `objmode` in groupby apply UDFs

-   Pandas coverage:

    -   Support `pd.DataFrame.duplicated()` with categorical data
    >
    -   Groupby support for min/max on categorical data
    >
    -   Support for categorical in `pd.Series.dropna`
    >
    -   Support nullable int array in `pd.Categorical` constructor
    >
    -   Support for `pd.Series.where` and `pd.Series.mask` with
        categorical data and a scalar value.
    >
    -   Support for `pd.Series.diff()`
    >
    -   Support for `pd.DataFrame.diff()`
    >
    -   Support for `pd.Series.repeat()`
    >
    -   Support list of functions in `groupby.agg()`
    >
    -   Support tuple of UDFs inside `groupby.agg()` dictionary case
    >
    -   Support single row and scalar UDF output in `groupby.apply()`
    >
    -   Support Categorical values in `Groupby.shift`
    >
    -   Support `case=False` in `Series.str.contains`
    >
    -   Support `mapper` with `axis=1` for `pd.DataFrame.rename`.
    >
    -   Support `Timedelta64` data in `pd.Groupby`
    >
    -   Support for `datetime.date` arrays in `Series.max` and
        `Series.min`
    >
    -   Support for `pd.timedelta_range`
    >
    -   Support equality between `datetime64`/`pd.Timestamp` and
        `timedelta64`/`pd.Timedelta`
    >
    -   Support for iterating across most index types
    >
    -   Support getting the `name` attribute of data inside `df.apply`
    >
    -   Support `Series.reset_index(drop=False)` for common cases
    >
    -   Support `==` and `!=` on Dataframe and a scalar with a
        different type
    >
    -   
    >
        Sequential support for `pd.Series.idxmax`, `pd.Series.idxmin`,
    >
        :   `pd.DataFrame.idxmax`, and `pd.DataFrame.idxmin` with
            Nullable and Categorical arrays.
