Bodo accelerates and scales data science programs automatically and enables instant deployment at any scale in all environments, eliminating the need to rewrite Python analytics code to Spark/Scala, SQL or MPI/C++. This tutorial provides a comprehensive overview of Bodo usage. For more details, please visit [docs.bodo.ai](https://docs.bodo.ai).\n",

    "Bodo uses [MPI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_Passing_Interface) for parallelization, which is automatically installed as part of the conda command above. MPI can be configured on clusters easily. The cluster nodes need to have passwordless SSH enabled between them, and there should be a host file listing their addresses (example tutorial [here](https://mpitutorial.com/tutorials/running-an-mpi-cluster-within-a-lan/))."

In general, the `distributed` flag can be used for both passing distributed chunks as input argument, as well as returning distributed chunks."
