 * The template is specialized on the element_type of pin_guard<Spillable>.
 *
 * It takes a function that pins the spillable and simply calls it, and if not
 * void, returns the value.
 *
 * The function cannot take the spillable because it is not a friend of the
 * Spillable class and thus may not be able to call pin().
 *
 * on the other hand, pin_guard is allowed to create a lambda to access pin()
 * within its definition since pin_guard<Spillable> is a friend of Spillable.
