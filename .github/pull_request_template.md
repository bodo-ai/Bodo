## Testing strategy

<!-- 
Before requesting review, verify that your changes pass PR CI by adding "[run ci]" to your commit message (or add a new blank commit with that message) or explain why CI is not necessary (e.g. docs changes). 

Briefly mention how this change is tested e.g. "new unit tests added". To pass automated coverage checks, ensure that you have added `# pragma: no cover` to jitted functions. 

Ensure that newly added tests work locally on 3 ranks using both SPMD and spawn mode (default) when applicable. For example:

SPMD mode: 
  `export BODO_SPAWN_MODE=0;
  mpiexec -n 3 pytest -svW ignore bodo/tests/test_dataframe.py::my_new_test`

Spawn mode (default mode): 
  `export BODO_NUM_WORKERS=3;
  pytest -svW ignore bodo/tests/test_dataframe.py::my_new_test`
