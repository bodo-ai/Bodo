<p><strong>THIS ONLINE END-USER LICENSE AGREEMENT ("AGREEMENT") IS A BINDING
LEGAL CONTRACT BETWEEN YOU (THE USER) AND BODO INC. ("WE", "US", OR
"BODO"). BY DOWNLOADING, INSTALLING, ACCESSING OR USING THE SOFTWARE,
SERVICES, AND ANY OTHER MATERIALS MADE AVAILABLE BY BODO ON THIS SITE OR
IN ANY OTHER FORMAT (COLLECTIVELY, THE "SERVICES"), YOU (A) AGREE TO
BE BOUND BY THIS AGREEMENT; (B) ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE YOU HAVE
INDEPENDENTLY EVALUATED THE DESIRABILITY OF USING THE SERVICES AND ARE
NOT RELYING ON ANY REPRESENTATION, GUARANTEE, OR STATEMENT OTHER THAN AS
EXPRESSLY PROVIDED IN THIS AGREEMENT; AND (C) REPRESENT YOU ARE LAWFULLY
ABLE TO ENTER INTO CONTRACTS AND ARE OF THE LEGAL AGE OF MAJORITY IN THE
JURISDICTION IN WHICH YOU RESIDE (AT LEAST EIGHTEEN YEARS OF AGE IN MANY
COUNTRIES/JURISDICTIONS). IF THIS AGREEMENT IS BEING AGREED TO BY A
COMPANY OR OTHER LEGAL ENTITY, THEN THE PERSON AGREEING TO THIS
AGREEMENT ON BEHALF OF THAT COMPANY OR ENTITY REPRESENTS AND WARRANTS
THAT HE OR SHE IS AUTHORIZED AND LAWFULLY ABLE TO BIND THAT COMPANY OR
ENTITY TO THIS AGREEMENT.</strong></p>
<p><strong>IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THIS AGREEMENT, YOU MAY NOT USE THE SERVICES.</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Services.</strong> Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement
    and, if applicable, your payment of all relevant fees, we grant you
    a non-exclusive, non-transferable, limited license to access and use
    our software services, content, and other materials provided by Bodo
    or its third-party vendors through this Web site or in other format
    (the "<strong>Services</strong>") for your internal use only. Certain
    third-party services may have their own terms and conditions, which
    will be presented to you in your use of the Services. Your use of
    those third-party services will indicate your acceptance of the
    additional terms and conditions. In connection with the Services, we
    may afford you the ability to interface and interoperate with
    certain third-party software and to upload data from that software.
    This functionality is dependent on the operation of the third-party
    software and is provided on an entirely as-is basis. We may change,
    modify, or discontinue all or any portion of the Services at any
    time, without prior notice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Restrictions.</strong> You may only use the Services as described in the
    documentation we make generally available from time to time to our
    customers for use of the Services (the "<strong>Documentation</strong>"). Any
    breach of this Agreement by your employees or agents will constitute
    a breach by you. Except as expressly authorized by this Agreement,
    you will not (and will not allow any third-party to): (i) permit any
    third-party to access and/or use the Services; (ii) decompile,
    disassemble, or reverse engineer the Services, or attempt to derive
    the source code, underlying ideas, algorithm or structure of
    software provided to you in object code form; (iii) use the Services
    or any of our Confidential Information (as defined below) to develop
    a competing product or service; (iv) sell, transfer, assign,
    distribute, rent, loan, lease, sublicense or otherwise make
    available the software associated with the Services or its
    functionality to third parties; (v) modify, translate or otherwise
    create any derivative works of any software used and made available
    by Bodo in connection with the Services; (vi) provide, lease, lend,
    use for timesharing or service bureau purposes or otherwise use or
    allow others to use the Services for the benefit of any third
    party; (vii) use the Services, or allow the transfer, transmission,
    export, or re-export of the Services, including by way of a "deemed
    export," in violation of any export control laws or regulations
    administered by the U.S. Commerce Department or any other government
    agency; or (viii) remove any copyright, trademark, proprietary
    rights, disclaimer or warning notice included on or embedded in any
    part of the Services or Documentation. Nothing in this Agreement
    shall be construed to give you a right to use, or otherwise obtain
    access to, any source code from which the software used in
    connection with the Services or any portion thereof is compiled or
    interpreted. Under no circumstances, will we be liable or
    responsible for any use, or any results obtained by the use, of the
    Services in conjunction with any other software or third-party
    products. All such use will be at your sole risk.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Proprietary Rights.</strong> You acknowledge that all Services are
    protected by intellectual property rights of Bodo and its
    vendors/licensors and that you have no rights to transfer or
    reproduce the Services or prepare any derivative works with respect
    to, or disclose Confidential Information pertaining to, the
    Services. Under no circumstances will you be deemed to receive title
    to any portion of any Services, title to which at all times will
    vest exclusively in us and our licensors. This is not a "work made
    for hire" agreement, as that term is defined in Section 101 of
    Title 17 of the United States Code ("<strong>the Copyright Act</strong>"). You
    will preserve all Services from any liens, encumbrances, and claims
    of any individual or entity. You will not use any of our information
    or data to contest the validity of any of our intellectual property
    or our licensors. Any such use of our information and data will
    constitute a material, non-curable breach of this Agreement. To the
    extent you provide us with any content (e.g., graphics, logos,
    artwork, text, data) for use in connection with the Services
    (collectively, the "<strong>Customer Content</strong>"), you grant us a
    non-exclusive, world-wide, royalty-free license to use the Customer
    Content for purposes of performing this Agreement. You are
    responsible for obtaining all rights, permissions, licenses, and
    consents required to furnish the Customer Content to us for use as
    described above. You are also responsible for preserving and making
    adequate backups of the Customer Content and will not rely on us to
    preserve or make adequate backups of data used in connection with
    the Services, or to maintain a record of your usage of any part or
    all of the Services. Your rights in and to the Services and related
    software are limited to those expressly granted under this Agreement
    and no other licenses are granted whether by implication, estoppel
    or otherwise. Bodo reserves all rights, title and interest in and to
    the Services and related software not expressly granted under this
    Agreement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Third Party Software.</strong> The Services may come bundled with, or
    otherwise include or be distributed with, third party software
    licensed by a Bodo supplier and/or open source software provided
    under an open source license (Open Source Software) (collectively,
    "<strong>Third Party Software</strong>"). Notwithstanding anything to the
    contrary herein, Third Party Software is licensed to you subject to
    the terms and conditions of the software license agreement
    accompanying such Third Party Software whether in the form of a
    discrete agreement, click-through license, or electronic license
    terms accepted at the time of installation and any additional terms
    or agreements provided by the third party licensor ("<strong>Third Party
    License Terms</strong>"). Use of the Third Party Software by you shall be
    governed by such Third Party License Terms, or if no Third Party
    License Terms apply, then the Third Party Software is provided to
    you as-is, as available, for use in or with the Services and not
    otherwise used separately. Copyright to Third Party Software is held
    by the copyright holders indicated in the Third Party License Terms.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Feedback.</strong> You may provide us with suggestions, comments or other
    feedback (collectively, "<strong>Feedback</strong>") with respect to our
    products and services, including the Services. Feedback is voluntary
    and we are not required to hold it in confidence. We may use
    Feedback for any purpose without obligation of any kind. To the
    extent a license is required under your intellectual property rights
    to make use of the Feedback, you grant us an irrevocable,
    non-exclusive, perpetual, royalty-free license to use the Feedback
    in connection with our business, products, and services, including
    the enhancement of the Services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Aggregated Data.</strong> You grant us a non-exclusive, perpetual,
    irrevocable, fully-paid-up, royalty free license to use data derived
    from your use of the Services (the "<strong>Aggregated Data</strong>") for our
    business purposes, including the provision of products and services
    to our customers; provided the Aggregated Data is combined with
    similar data from our other customers. "<strong>Aggregated Data</strong>" does
    not include (directly or by inference) any information identifying
    you or any identifiable individual. You further grant us the right
    to (i) use the Aggregated Data in any aggregate or statistical
    products or reports, (ii) transfer and/or disclose the Aggregated
    Data upon a sale of our company or its assets or other form of
    reorganization, (iii) disclose Aggregated Data in a summary report
    that does not show, display or indicate customer specific or
    customer identifying information, (iv) provide Aggregated Data to a
    third party service provider, for analytical purposes, and (v) use
    the Aggregated Data (without personally identifiable information) to
    compare with other organizations within the same industry or group.
    The Aggregated Data will not be considered your Confidential
    Information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Fees.</strong> You will promptly pay Bodo all applicable fees and, as
    described below, taxes associated with the Services. Except as
    expressly provided otherwise in this Agreement, all fees (if any)
    are non-refundable. Payments not made within such time period will
    be subject to late charges equal to the lesser of (i) one and
    one-half percent (1.5%) per month of the overdue amount or (ii) the
    maximum amount permitted under applicable law. You are responsible
    for paying all personal property, sales, use and other taxes
    (excluding taxes based upon our net income) and license and
    registration fees and other assessments or charges levied or imposed
    by any governmental body or agency as a result of the execution or
    performance of this Agreement, including your receipt of the
    Services. On notice of not less than sixty (60) days, we may, in our
    discretion, adjust any or all fees for the Services. You may
    terminate this Agreement on written notice to us within thirty (30)
    days of its receipt of our notice to adjust the fees; <em>provided,
    however,</em> that if you do not object to the adjustment in writing
    within the foregoing thirty (30) day period then you will be deemed
    to have agreed to the adjustment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Your Warranties.</strong> You represent and warrant that (i) you have
    full power, capacity, and authority to enter into this Agreement and
    to grant the license in Section 4 (Proprietary Rights); and (ii)
    your use of the Services will be in compliance with all applicable
    local, state, and federal laws and regulations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Indemnification.</strong> You will defend and indemnify Bodo and hold it
    and its affiliates, officers, directors, employees, and agents
    harmless from any and all claims, actions, proceedings, losses,
    deficiencies, damages, liabilities, costs, and expenses (including
    but not limited to reasonable attorneys' fees and all related costs
    and expenses) incurred by them as a result of any claim, judgment,
    or adjudication related to or arising from any or all of the
    following: (i) your use of the Services; (ii) breach of any of your
    obligations, representations, or warranties in this Agreement;
    or (iii) your failure to comply with applicable laws and
    regulations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Beta Services.</strong> We may designate certain new functionality or
    services to be made available in connection with the Services as
    "<strong>Beta Services</strong>." The Beta Services will not be ready for use
    in a production environment. Because they will be at an early stage
    of development, operation and use of the Beta Services may be
    unpredictable and lead to erroneous results. You acknowledge and
    agree that: (i) the Beta Services will be experimental and will not
    have been fully tested; (ii) the Beta Services may not meet your
    requirements; (iii) the use or operation of the Beta Services may
    not be uninterrupted or error free; and (iv) your use of the Beta
    Services will be for purposes of evaluating and testing the new
    functionality and services and providing feedback to us. Your use of
    the Beta Services will be subject to all of the terms and conditions
    of this Agreement relating to the Services. You agree to promptly
    report any errors, defects, or other deficiencies in the Beta
    Services to us. NOTWITHSTANDING ANY OTHER PROVISION OF THIS
    AGREEMENT, ALL BETA SERVICES ARE PROVIDED "AS-IS" AND
    "AS-AVAILABLE," WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND. You waive any and
    all claims, now known or later discovered, that you may have against
    us and our suppliers and licensors arising out of the Beta Services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Suspension or Termination of Services and Removal of Customer
    Content.</strong> We may, in our sole discretion, suspend your access to
    the Services for any of the following reasons: (i) to prevent
    disruption of or damages to, or degradation of, the Services and our
    systems; (ii) to comply with any law, regulation, court order, or
    other governmental request; (iii) to otherwise protect us from
    potential legal liability; (iv) to remove Customer Content that is
    illegal, offensive, or otherwise inappropriate, in our sole
    discretion, or (iv) in the event an invoice remains unpaid for more
    than forty-five (45) or more days from the invoice date. We will
    restore access to the Services as soon as the event giving rise to
    suspension has been resolved. This Section will not be construed as
    imposing any obligation or duty on us to monitor use of the
    Services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Confidentiality.</strong> 12.1 "Confidential Information" means all
    information or material which (i) gives a party some competitive
    business advantage or the opportunity of obtaining such advantage or
    the disclosure of which could be detrimental to the interests of
    that party; or (ii) which from all the relevant circumstances should
    reasonably be assumed to be confidential and proprietary. Each
    party's Confidential Information will remain the sole and exclusive
    property of that party. Confidential Information includes, but is
    not limited to, the Services. Neither party will have any obligation
    with respect to confidential information which: (i) is or becomes
    generally known to the public by any means other than a breach of
    the obligations of a receiving party; (ii) was previously known to
    the receiving party or rightly received by the receiving party from
    a third party; (iii) is independently developed by the receiving
    party; or (iv) subject to disclosure under court order or other
    lawful process.</p>
<p>12.2 Treatment of Confidential Information. Each party recognizes
the importance of the other party's Confidential Information. In
particular, each party recognizes and agrees that the Confidential
Information of the other is critical to their respective businesses
and that neither party would enter into this Agreement without
assurance that the information will be protected as provided in this
Section 12 and elsewhere in this Agreement. Accordingly, each party
agrees as follows:</p>
<p>(a) Each party will hold any and all Confidential Information it
    obtains in strictest confidence and will use and permit use of
    Confidential Information solely as permitted under this
    Agreement; and
(b) Each party may disclose or provide access to its responsible
    employees and agents or as otherwise permitted under this
    Agreement, and may make copies, of Confidential Information only
    to the extent permitted under this Agreement.</p>
<p>12.3 Non-Exclusive Equitable Remedy. Each party acknowledges and
agrees that due to the unique nature of the Confidential Information
there can be no adequate remedy at law for any breach of its
obligations hereunder, and therefore, that upon any such breach or
any threat thereof, each party will be entitled to appropriate
equitable relief from a court of competent jurisdiction in addition
to whatever remedies either of them might have at law or equity.</p>
<p>12.4 You agree not to use any Confidential Information of Bodo, and
shall restrict your affiliates and sublicensees from using the
Confidential Information of Bodo, for purposes of challenging the
validity of such Confidential Information, or Bodo's ability to use
and exploit such Confidential Information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Limited Warranty; Exclusive Remedy.</strong> During the Term, Bodo
    warrants the Services will materially comply with the requirements
    of this Agreement and Documentation. In the event of a breach of the
    foregoing warranty, Bodo's sole and exclusive liability and your
    sole and exclusive remedy will be to use reasonable efforts to
    correct the non-conformity. In the event Bodo is unable through
    reasonable efforts to correct the defective Service, you may elect
    to terminate this Agreement and, if applicable, receive a prorated
    refund of any pre-paid, unused recurring fees.</p>
</li>
<li>

    BODO AND ITS VENDORS AND LICENSORS TO YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY ARISING

    IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO THE LIABILITY. THIS
    LIMITATION OF LIABILITY WILL APPLY EVEN IF THE EXPRESS WARRANTIES
    PROVIDED ABOVE FAIL OF THEIR ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Term and Termination.</strong> Unless otherwise agreed by the parties,
    the Agreement shall be on-going until terminated by either party on
    thirty (30) days prior notice to the other party. In the event we
    terminate this Agreement for reasons other than breach of contract,
    any prepaid but unused fees will be refunded.</p>
</li>
<li>

    ("<strong>USA Patriot Act</strong>") provides generally for the operator of a
    communication host and law enforcement to be able to monitor any
    content, upon request of the operator. We anticipate fully complying
    with our obligations and availing ourselves of all rights under the
    USA Patriot Act.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>General.</strong> Except for the payment of fees, if applicable, neither
    party will be liable for any failure or delay in performance under
    this Agreement which is due to any event beyond the reasonable
    control of such party, including without limitation, fire,
    explosion, unavailability of utilities or raw materials, Internet
    delays and failures, telecommunications failures, unavailability of
    components, labor difficulties, war, riot, act of God, export
    control regulation, laws, judgments or government instructions. This
    Agreement provides the entire agreement between the parties with
    regard to its subject matter. Except as provided below, this
    Agreement may not be amended without a writing signed by both
    parties. We may, at any time and from time-to-time, change the terms
    of this Agreement. Any changes will be posted on our Web site. In
    addition, we may also send you a notice about the amended terms via
    email. If you do not accept the terms of any modification, your only
    recourse is to terminate this Agreement by sending a termination
    notice us before the effective date of the amendments. The
    termination will be effective on the date we receive the notice. The
    most current version of the Agreement will be available on our Web
    site and will supersede all previous versions of the Agreement. Your
    continued use of the Services will constitute your acceptance of the
    changes. This Agreement will be construed according to, and the
    rights of the parties will be governed by, the law of the State of
    California, without reference to its conflict of laws rules. Any
    action at law or in equity arising out of or directly or indirectly
    relating to this Agreement may be instituted only in the Federal or
    state courts located in San Francisco, California. You consent and
    submit to the personal jurisdiction of those courts for the purposes
    of any action related to this Agreement, and to extra-territorial
    service of process. No action, regardless of form, arising out of
    this Agreement, may be brought by either party more than one (1)
    year after the cause of action has arisen. You may not assign this
    Agreement without the prior written consent of Bodo. If any of the
    provisions of this Agreement are found or deemed by a court to be
    invalid or unenforceable, they will be severable from the remainder
    of this Agreement and will not cause the invalidity or
    unenforceability of the remainder of this Agreement. Neither party
    will by mere lapse of time without giving notice or taking other
    action hereunder be deemed to have waived any breach by the other
    party of any of the provisions of this Agreement. The following
    provisions will survive termination or expiration of this Agreement:
    4 (Proprietary Rights), 9 (Indemnification), 12 (Confidentiality),
    13 (Limited Warranty; Exclusive Remedy); 14 (Disclaimer of
    Warranties), 15 (Limitation of Liability and Damages), 17
    (Government Restrictions), 18 (USA Patriot Act Notice), and 19
    (General Provisions). This Agreement may be accepted in electronic
    form (e.g., by an electronic or other means of demonstrating assent)
    and your acceptance will be deemed binding between us. Neither of us
    will contest the validity or enforceability of this Agreement and
    any related documents, including under any applicable statute of
    frauds, because they were accepted or signed in electronic form.</p>
